# Instagram Targeted Marketing and Personalization Pipeline

##  The goal of this project is to analyze Instagram influencer data using the Pandas library and other necessary tools such as Numpy and Seaborn to build a marketing and personalization strategy. We'll preprocess the data, perform exploratory analysis, segment influencers, and create personalized collaboration offers based on metrics like engagement rate, followers, and influence score.
